Desription:

This is the newest version of the Voron Mod for COP.
Now the dialog window stay in the main menu, so you can take your time to choose the items you want to spawn without risk to be killed.
You can list the items by clicking on the buttons at the top of the window.   
You are also able to transport you instantly in the level with the new Teleporter dialog. 
The future version of this mod will contain a parser, this way, Voron will be able to spawn items from others mods.


How to use:

Load a saved game, then in the game level hit Escape.

To open the 'Spawner window', hit the F1 key.

To run the 'Teleporter dialog', hit the F2 key.

Notes:

This mod was tested with Stalker Call Of Pripyat version 1.6.00. 
_____________________________________________________________________________

Installation:

Unzip everything into your "Stalker Call Of Pripyat" directory. 

If you have not used mods before, you will need to open your "fsgame.ltx" file, found in the "program files/thq/Stalker" directory.

Open this file with a text editor and find the following line:

$game_data$ = false| true| $fs_root$| gamedata

Change the false to true, i.e.:

$game_data$ = true| true| $fs_root$| gamedata
